::: section introduction

> Excuse me, but, there's a container for that :)

A battle-hardened technologist interested in building beautiful, large-scale and user-friendly web and mobile applications. ♥ functional programming, full-stack coding, optimising infrastructure, the command line & Vim. When not behind the keyboard, I'm cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to micro-containers.

♥ building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products & getting my hands dirty with code when duty calls. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a _never say die_ attitude to the team and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. ♥ writing tests & teach as much as I learn.
