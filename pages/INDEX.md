::: section introduction
> Excuse me, but, there's a container for that :)

A battle-hardened technologist interested in building beautiful, large-scale and user-friendly web and mobile applications. ♥ functional programming, coding UI, the command line & Vim. When not coding, I'm cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to micro-containers.

♥ building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products & getting my hands dirty with code when duty calls. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to the team and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. ♥ writing tests & teach as much as I learn.

#### **Jun 2016 - Dec '17** Front-end Team Lead

##### **BAE Systems Applied Intelligence** | _Kuala Lumpur_

Engineered a web app built on Angular, ES7/8, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser/device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.

- Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application & mobile app which strict acceptance criteria for performance in low bandwidth areas.
- Engaged with UX daily to ensure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product, advising against bad user experience and convoluted user journeys.
- Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded with clear acceptance criteria and most importantly, closable.
- Spearheaded a culture of writing good code with performance and usability as pillars.
- Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team, and delivering features 4-5 sprints ahead of schedule.
- Promoted reusablity and configurability by building a library of UX components within the first couple of sprints - resulting in minimal to no effort necessary to implement features at the later stages.
- Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments - delivered with 90% test coverage when expected baseline was 80%.
- Streamlined team output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task delegation. We closed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistently, keeping morale and confidence high.
- Automated repetitive DevOps and pushed the mobile apps to the Apple/Google stores with one command using fastlane.
